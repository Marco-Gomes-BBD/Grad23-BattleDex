Considerations:
  Unit testing?

  L-System:
    Keywords should be configurable
    Should we allow circular references?

  Slide parameters:
    How many slides? slideCount
    How much time per slide? slideDuration
    How long should the presentation be? 05:00. slideshowDuration = slideCount * slideDuration
    Should the decks be shuffled or ordered? Probably not.
